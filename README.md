# Image-editor
This is an image editing application written entirely in Python 2 that is comprised of two parts- An intuitive GUI for single image editing and a text-based interface for editing an entire folder of images at once. This project just scratches the surface, and it has been made in a way such that new functions for editing images can easily be added, thus making this application mouldable to every user's needs.
